## How to run the database system and this web application in your machine?

- First unzip the project folder which I'm send you with the attachment.

- Then simply move the extracted file of this web app into the `PHP`'s or
  `XAMPP`'s `htdocs` folder.

- Then you will start the `MySQL & Apache` Server.

- Simple import the `assignment.sql` file in your datable which file I will put

### How can I do, to build the simple web application,

- 1. At first I design three web page such as `login, register & profile` pages
     using HTML5 and CSS3.

- 2. Then I create a database for this web application which name as
     `assignment` and create two table `(user & profile)` of the assignment
     database for manage the users data and their profile data.

- 3. Here I'm use the `RDBMS` (Relation Database Management System) of MySQL and
     MariyaDB.

- 4. For my server side programming I'm use the popular web programming language
     such as `PHP`.

- 5. I'm make two controller such as
     `AuthenticationController & ProfileController` using php OPP way.

- 6. I handle all the user's request and other business logics in this
     controller files.

## At last, How to run a `PHP` web application from scratch in our local machine try to follow those step which are down below:

- 1. Install a web server: Start by installing a web server software such as
     Apache, Nginx, or XAMPP (which includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP). Choose the
     server that best fits your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and
     follow the installation instructions provided by the server's
     documentation.

- 2. Set up your project directory: Create a directory in the web server's
     document root folder where you'll store your PHP project files. For
     example, if you're using Apache, the document root directory is typically
     named "htdocs" or "www" (depending on your server configuration). Place
     your PHP files inside this directory.

- 3. Start the web server: Launch your web server software and ensure it is
     running. Verify that the server is working by visiting http://localhost in
     your web browser. If the server is set up correctly, you should see a
     default page or a server information page.

- 4. Access your PHP project: To access your PHP project, open a web browser and
     enter the URL corresponding to the location of your PHP files. For example,
     if your project is located at http://localhost/myproject, enter that URL in
     the browser. If everything is configured correctly, your PHP project should
     be displayed in the browser.
